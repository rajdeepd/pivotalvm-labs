This is an update of the original "Labs" directory for the immersion sessions.
This assumes that a previous "Labs" directory exists on the VM, under the
~gpadmin/Immersion/ directory, where the "Lab_2" directory contains a number
of .tsv.gz files, which total around 250 MB in size.  The goal is to preserve
those large data files, saving them into the "data" directory, removing all of
the previous "Lab_?" directories.

Running the script "update_labs.sh" will do this.
