HAWQ create tables exercise

(a) Review the DDL SQL script for all the tables for the labs:

    vi (or 'less', 'more', ...) retail_demo_GPXF.sql

(b) Use the "psql" HAWQ client to run the DDL SQL script:
    
    psql -f retail_demo_GPXF.sql

(c) Once complete, you should be able to log in with psql and observe the result:

[gpadmin@pivhdsne]$ psql
Timing is on.
